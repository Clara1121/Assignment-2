            <p>Concerned Ape made Stardew Valley as an indie developer and continued to update it consistenly while also working on his second game Haunted Chocolatier</p> 
            <p>I enjoy this game as it doesn't require a massive amount of attention and has a calming soundtrack.It has a variety of ways to play from farming to mining and socialising with villagers and learning more about you're new home.</p>
            <blockquote>I made Stardew Valley alone over the course of 4.5 years. When I started, I didn't know much about making a video game, but I learned the necessary skills as time went on. It was my dream to make a modern game in the tradition of the SNES and PS1 Harvest Moon games. After Stardew Valley launched for PC, it quickly became a global success.</blockquote><p>-Eric Barone(Concerned Ape)</p>
